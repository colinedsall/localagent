# Manual Testing & Verification Guide

This guide explains how to manually inspect, simulate, and verify the Verilog files generated by the agent.

## File Locations
*   **Temporary Build Files**: Located in `build/`. These are overwritten on every run.
    *   `generated_module.v`: The design file.
    *   `generated_module_tb.v`: The testbench file.
    *   `generated_module.out`: The compiled simulation executable.
*   **Saved Designs**: Located in `designs/<timestamp>_<name>/`.
    *   `design.v`: Finalized design.
    *   `testbench.v`: Finalized testbench.

## Running Simulations Manually
You can run `iverilog` directly on the generated files to verify them yourself or to debug specific issues.

### 1. Change to the Workspace
```bash
cd build
# OR
cd designs/20250109_123045_my_counter
```

### 2. Compile
Use `iverilog` to compile the design and testbench into a simulation executable (`sim.out`).
```bash
iverilog -o sim.out generated_module.v generated_module_tb.v
# OR for saved designs
iverilog -o sim.out design.v testbench.v
```

**Common Errors:**
*   `syntax error`: Check the line number in the Verilog file.
*   `unknown module`: Ensure both the design and testbench are included in the command.

### 3. Run Simulation
Execute the compiled simulation.
```bash
vvp sim.out
```
This will print the output (from `$display` calls) to the terminal.

## Viewing Waveforms
If you want to see the signal waveforms to debug timing issues:

1.  **Modify the Testbench**: Open the testbench file and add the following block inside the `initial` block:
    ```verilog
    initial begin
        $dumpfile("waveform.vcd");
        $dumpvars(0, tb_module_name); // Replace tb_module_name with the actual TB module name
    end
    ```
2.  **Recompile & Run**: Run `iverilog` and `vvp` again.
3.  **Open Waveform**:
    *   **Mac**: Use `gtkwave`.
        ```bash
        brew install gtkwave
        gtkwave waveform.vcd
        ```
    *   **VS Code**: Install a "WaveTrace" or "Verilog" extension to view `.vcd` files directly in the editor.
